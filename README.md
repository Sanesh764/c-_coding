## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

You can run any file using a C++ compiler (like G++) or an IDE like VS Code.

**Using Terminal (G++):**
1.  Navigate to the folder:
    ```bash
    cd Array
    ```
2.  Compile the file:
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o output
    ```
3.  Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./output
    ```
